Modulation is the process of changing the characteristics of a waveform, such as its frequency, phase, or amplitude, to convey information. The information to be transmitted, known as the message signal, is superimposed on a high-frequency carrier wave, known as the carrier signal, to create the modulated signal. The modulated signal is then transmitted over a communication channel, and the original message signal can be recovered by demodulating the received signal.

One of the simplest forms of modulation is Frequency Shift Keying (FSK). FSK is a digital modulation technique in which the frequency of the carrier signal is changed to represent the digital data. In FSK, the carrier frequency is shifted between two discrete frequencies, one for a binary 1 and another for a binary 0.

For example, in a binary FSK system, a frequency of 2000 Hz might be used to represent a binary 0 and a frequency of 3000 Hz might be used to represent a binary 1. If the message to be transmitted is "0101", the modulated signal would alternate between 2000 Hz and 3000 Hz to represent the 0s and 1s in the message.

To generate an FSK modulated signal, we can use a simple Python script like the one I provided earlier. The script accepts a message as a command-line argument, converts the message to binary, and then generates a time vector. For each bit in the binary message, it generates a sinusoid at the appropriate frequency (2000 Hz or 3000 Hz) for the corresponding bit value (0 or 1) and concatenates the sinusoids to create the modulated signal.

One of the advantages of FSK is its robustness against noise. Since the signal changes frequency with each bit, the receiver can recover the original signal even if the signal is distorted by noise. FSK is also relatively simple to implement and is used in a variety of communication systems, such as radio modems, pagers, and some types of wireless networks.

In conclusion, modulation is an essential technique used in communication systems to transmit information over a communication channel. FSK is a simple and robust form of modulation that changes the frequency of a carrier signal to represent digital data, and it's widely used in different communication systems.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

# FSK parameters
bit_rate = 1000 # bits per second
freq_low = 2000 # Hz
freq_high = 3000 # Hz

# Get message from command-line argument
message = sys.argv[1]

# Convert message to binary
message = ''.join(format(ord(x), 'b') for x in message)

# Generate time vector
T = len(message) / bit_rate
t = np.linspace(0, T, int(np.ceil(T * bit_rate)) * len(message))

# Initialize modulated signal as empty list
mod_sig = []

# Modulate the message
for i in range(len(message)):
    if message[i] == '1':
        mod_sig.append(np.sin(2*np.pi*freq_high*t[i*len(t)//len(message):(i+1)*len(t)//len(message)]))
    else:
        mod_sig.append(np.sin(2*np.pi*freq_low*t[i*len(t)//len(message):(i+1)*len(t)//len(message)]))

# Concatenate the modulated signal
mod_sig = np.concatenate(mod_sig)

# Convert mod_sig to complex 32 values
mod_sig = mod_sig.astype(np.complex64)

# Save mod_sig to file
np.save("fsk_mod.raw", mod_sig)

# Plot the modulated signal
plt.plot(t, mod_sig)
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.title('FSK modulated signal')
plt.show()
